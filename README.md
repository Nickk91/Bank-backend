# Bank-API-Backend

I have created a backend server for a bank API using express.

I have used Postman for the endpoints with a port of 3000.

### Users info:

I have json data with users , each user has :

- auto generated ID [used uuid package]
- userId
- fName
- lName
- credit

## Things to know:

- When a user withdraws money from his account , first he will withdraw from his cash and if he doesn't have anymore cash
  he will withdraw from his credit.

- When a user transfers money from his bank account to another user , he will transfer using cash and if he doesn't have cash anymore he will transfer his credit , and the other user will always get the money as credit and not as cash.

- You cannot deposit , withdraw , update credit and transfer from/to inActive users!

## How to:

I have mentioned above how to GET users info , in this section i will be putting the URLs for the other endpoints.
You can try these endpoints in Postman like i did.

- Create a user: api/v1/bank then put the user info in the body. [name , cash , credit]
- Delete a user: /api/v1/bank/ [user id]
- Deposit cash to a user: /api/v1/bank/deposit/ [user id] ?cash=[amount of cash]
- Update credits of a user: /api/v1/bank/ [user id] ?credit=[amount of credit]
- Withdraw money : /api/v1/bank/withdraw/ [user id] ?money=[amount of money]
- Transfer money: /api/v1/bank/transfer/from/ [sender id] /to/ [recipient id] ?money=[amount of money]
